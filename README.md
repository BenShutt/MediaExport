# Media Export

A SwiftUI iOS app that syncs media on the device (images, videos, etc) with a server over the WIFI.

It is written as client for a [C-Server](https://github.com/BenShutt/C-Playground/tree/develop/Server) project that I worked on for learning purposes.

It is merely a developer-tool and not to be used for anything more.
